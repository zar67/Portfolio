For the Global Game Jam 2020, the theme was <em>"repair"</em>. I grouped up with a small team of friends and we got to work Friday night thinking of a game. Several ideas were brought up and we quickly became interested in the thought of re-pairing something; like bringing a couple back together or re-pairing to a bluetooth speaker.

By the end of Friday night we had our game idea ready: A 2D top-down party game where player have to re-pair to bluetooth speakers and dance to earn points.

For this game, I worked on the UI of the main game screen as well as the speakers. Since there was 5 or us and the main technical requirement of our game was the AI, there wasn't alot of work to go around. I also helped with making some of the sprites for the game.
