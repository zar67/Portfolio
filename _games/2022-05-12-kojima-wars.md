As part of our final year of university we had to work together as a year group to create a game. We were given the task to recreate an old RTS in 3D. My group was given the feature of 'bases' which included the capturing of bases as the win condition.

The full devlog for my contributions to the project can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/KojimaWars/Cohort Project Devlog.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
