During my time at Sumo Leamington I was loaned to Midoki to give them some support on their Knighthood project. The primary focus was to help reduce Crashes and ANRs in their game Knighthood.
More information about the game can be found [here](https://www.midoki.com/knighthood.html).

During my time on the project I worked on various bugs, crashes and ANRs in the game project and their [MDK technology](https://www.midoki.com/mdk.html). I also added a few new libraries and tool to help detect and reduce crashes.
