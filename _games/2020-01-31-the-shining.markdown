<h3>Brief</h3>

The Shining is a singleplayer 2D rogue like adventure game made as part of my Low Level Programming module at UWE Bristol. The player has to escape a haunted hotel with ghosts and demons, while avoiding the psycho axe-man who mysteriously can't die. Kill the enemies and escape the psycho to complete the game.

This task was a group project with creative freedom to create whatever style of game we wanted but inspired by the 80s classic The Shining. Our only technical requirements were to have an object oriented structure and correct memory management My group and I decided to make a 2D top-down rouge-like inspired by The Binding of Isaac with a Shining theme. The game can be controlled with a Keyboard and Mouse or a Game Controller. 

For this game, I implemented the UI system, the demon enemies and the random room generation. My development process and more information can be found on my devlog <a href="https://zar67.github.io/Portfolio/blog.html#The%20Shining%20Devlog">here</a>.
