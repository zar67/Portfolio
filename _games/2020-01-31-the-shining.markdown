As part of one of my modules for uni we were given the task to create a game,= in groups based on the shining. 

Me and my group decided to make a 2D top-down rouge-like inspired by The Binding of Isaac with a Shining theme. We decided the player would be escaping the hotel, with the psycho axe man (Jack Torrance) running after you, trying to kill you.

For this game, I implemented the UI system, the demon enemies and the random room generation. My development process and more information can be found on my devlog <a target="_blank" href="https://uwegames-llp.github.io/the-shining-devlog-zar67/">here</a>.
