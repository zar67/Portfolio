Tank Wars is a multiplayer RPG where players win by destroying the enemy base camps. The game features a grid based map that tanks can move on and different unit types with different stats.

This task was a group project to create a networked turn-based game and to also implement threading. The game was created in C++ using the <a href="https://github.com/HuxyUK/ASGE" target="_blank">ASGE</a> game framework created by our professor, James Huxtable, as well as a networking package called <a href="https://github.com/Lily-J-Dev/NetLibrary" target="_blank">NetLibrary</a> written by a former student.

For this game, I implemented most of the networking and UI. My development process and more information can be found on my devlog which is linked above.
