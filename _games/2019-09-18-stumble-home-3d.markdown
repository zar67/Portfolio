I remade Stumble Home in order to improve my 3D Unity skills. I had only dabbled in making 2D games before then so this was my first real try in 3D apart from some small coursework projects.

I also improved the sibling, she randomly comes out of her room thoughout the game, meaning sometimes you may not even meet her. When she does appear she comes out of her room and heads towards the kitchen sink for some water and then heads back to her room. If she notices you at any point then you will have to bribe her before you can go to bed. The sibling has such amazing sight that sometimes she sees you around corners...
