This Angry Birds remake was my second piece of coursework for my first year of university. I had to make a simple game where you could catapault an object into something else to make it disappear; I expanded on this by creating structures and a very simple (and somewhat buggy) physics simulation to handle the collisions and the resolutions. 

As the first time trying to implement physics into a game from scratch this task was very challenging to me, but I plan in future to try and enhance the game and improve the codebase to be cleaner, more readable and generally just better.

As you can see in the video, the physics isn't perfect...

These screenshots show the 2 levels currently in the game. Each level has a number of pigs and some structures to hold them up.
