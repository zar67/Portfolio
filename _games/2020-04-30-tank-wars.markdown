<h3>Brief</h3>

Tank Wars is a multiplayer RPG where player have to defeat all the other players by managing their tanks and destroying the enemy base camps. The game features a grid based map that tanks can move on and different unit types with different stats.

This task was a group project to create a networked turn-based game and to also implement threading.

For this game, I implemented most of the networking and UI. My development process and more information can be found on my devlog <a href="https://zar67.github.io/Portfolio/blog.html#Tank%20Wars%20Devlog">here</a>.
