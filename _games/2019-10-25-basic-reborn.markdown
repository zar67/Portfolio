<h3>Brief</h3>

We were given the task for one of my university modules to port a text adventure game made in BASIC to C++, adding in Object Oriented programming and fixing any bugs we came across. The game we ported was the from the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Write-Your-Own-Adventure-Microcomputer/dp/0686878329" target="_blank">Write Your Own Adventure: Programs for Your Microcomputer></a> book. We were first tasked with writing the game out in BASIC, a painstakingly long process that took around 4 hours in total of copying code and fixing many syntax errors.

The goal of the game is to navigate through a haunted house and collect all the valuable items before trying to escape. The player uses text commands such as EXAMINE OBJECT and MOVE NORTH to progress through the game.

The video below shows the BASIC version of the game running:
