We were given the task for one of my university modules to port a text adventure game made in BASIC to C++, adding in Object Oriented programming and fixing any bugs we came across. The game we ported was the from the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Write-Your-Own-Adventure-Microcomputer/dp/0686878329" target="_blank">Write Your Own Adventure: Programs for Your Microcomputer></a> book. We were first tasked with writing the game out in BASIC, a painstakingly long process that took around 4 hours in total of copying code and fixing many syntax errors.

The video below shows the BASIC version of the game running:
