Stampede is the first released professional project I have worked on. It is a 60 player battle royale racing game.
More information about the game can be found [here](https://www.sumo-digital.com/games/stampede-racing-royale/).

During my time on the project I have primarily worked on many of the UI and Meta features of the game. Some of my main contributions have been:
- Season Pass
- Kart Progression
- Player Profile
- Shop
- Inbox
- Settings
- Customization Screens
- HUD

I have also been a part of or improved many of the other UI and meta features in the game. 

In addition, during my time on the project I started looking into the backend to support some of the meta features. I began fixing bugs and implementing new features in the backend.
