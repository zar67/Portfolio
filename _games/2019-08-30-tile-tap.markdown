Tile Tap is my first game released on an app store. It is a simple clicker game where you have to grow your resources. You can do this by buying new tiles that generate resources or by creating building that generate more resources quicker.

The idea of the game is to be a quick mobile game, tapping on tiles and gaining resources.
