Our first task in my Advanced Technologies module was to develop a retro style FPS, like Doom, in DirectX.

Due to previous coursework projects in previous years, I knew how to structure my code with a component based architecture and so decided to try and implement that while also learning DirectX. The following are systems I implemented using only the main DirectX libraries:
- Rendering of objects
- Texturing
- Keyboar and Mouse input
- Camera movement
- SAT collisions
- Raycast shooting
- Animations
- Simple point lighting
- UI elements

More information in how I developed the game can be found in the video logs <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrr5q99QVCgQ9nvAoHRC83NKl4EfjXSu" target="_blank">here</a>.
