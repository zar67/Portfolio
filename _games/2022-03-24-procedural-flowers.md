One of the final tasks I worked on at UWE, Bristol was procedurally generating plants. I chose to generate flowers and to produce a tool that could create several different types of flowers. 

This involved a lot of research into how flowers grow and are constructed including maths such as Fermat's spiral and the golden angle.

I created a shape generation tool using splines to allow the user to create unique shape for petals and leaves. Then I created the generation tool which has many parameters for the user to play around with to create different types of flowers.

More information in how I developed the tool can be found in the video logs <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrr5q99QVCgQ9nvAoHRC83NKl4EfjXSu" target="_blank">here</a>.

The final report of the project can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/ProceduralFlowers/ProceduralFlowers-Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
