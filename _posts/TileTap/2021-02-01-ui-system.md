Over the last week or so I have been implementing the UI into the project. Most of this code setup is already in the RowbotTools package I developed and used so I spent this week using the setup I already had to create the UI and flow I wanted. 

<video controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Blog/TileTap2/ui-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

I also setup the localisation system from RowbotTools, this uses an excel file to retrieve localised text. At the moment this system is very simplistic and doesn't account for in-game variables that might need to be added to text. Adding runtime variables this is very complex functionality to add into a localisation system when you start to include language specific rules.

Currently the UI functionality is not complete, some of the buttons don't do their intended functionality quite yet, but the flow it completely up and running.
