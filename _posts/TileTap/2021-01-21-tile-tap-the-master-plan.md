With some new found inspiration I have decided to remake my game 'Tile Tap' with my new and improved knowledge, as well as my self-developed set of Unity tools. 

The project is temporarily named Tile Tap 2: Electric Boogaloo, but I will be coming up with a proper name later in the development process.

<h3>Original Project</h3>
The original Tile Tap project was a simple game where you tapped on tiles to collect resources and built buildings with the resources and money you gain.

The main things missing from the original game are:
- Main Menu and UI
- Saving and Loading
- Incentives for Exploration

<h3>RowbotTools Package</h3>
During the last six months I have been developing a set of tools to aid development in Unity called RowbotTools. There is a variety of systems included in this package, too many to list here, however I will be using this package with development of Tile Tap 2. 

There will be references to the RowbotTools package code to give an understanding of how Tile Tap 2 works to help explain how I'm making the game. I am also likely to be developing the RowbotTools package alongside Tile Tap 2 and during other projects if I find new systems to implement or issues in the current systems.

Currently I have setup a blank Unity project and added the RowbotTools package. I have also added the [Kenney Hexagon Sprites](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/hexagon-kit) that I intend to use for the project, I will likely have to modify this since there are river connections missing and there are some terrain types I want to add (like snowy biomes).
