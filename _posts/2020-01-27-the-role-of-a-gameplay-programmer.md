A Gameplay Programmer is described as a programmer who creates code that directly affects player experience and implements game mechanics and logic. However, responsibilities differ widely between companies and so Gameplay Programmers need to be flexible and have knowledge in a variety of areas. Gameplay Programmers make design ideas come to life by creating systems for the designers to use and to build the game from. Therefore, Gameplay Progammers work closely with the design team to implement the desired mechanics of a game. A Gameplay Programmer can also be referred to as a Software Engineer or Game Developer.

Mechanics a Gameplay Programmer could implement include: artificial intelligence, user interfaces, character mechanics, networking, weapon systems, shop systems, level generation, game progression and many more. Essentially, Gameplay Programmers will complete any aspects of gameplay that the company does not have a specialist for.
A Gameplay Programmer can a senior role in one company but also can be an entry level job in another. Senior Gameplay Programmers often work with and coordinate other programmers to define and complete milestones, whereas Gameplay Programmers will report to a lead programmer and create the code for systems in the game.
Requirements for a Gameplay Programmer are very similar across different companies, the most important requirements are a familiarity with C++ and the ability to be flexible with a knowledge of a lot of game mechanics and features.

A Gameplay Programmer is a very versatile role, every game will require different features and mechanics. Compared to Game Engine Programmers, the code produced by Gameplay Programmers doesn’t necessarily need to a fully working and flexible system, since it is built for one specific game; meaning Gameplay Programmers need to know when to refine a system versus a quick but limited build to suit the needs of the game.
