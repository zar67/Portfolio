This is the basic UML for our game, with the networking client and server setup. I have split our UMLs into different sections so that they are easier to read and to put on a document for our TDD.

This is just the base classes we will need for running a networked application, as we plan out specific features of our code, we will create UML diagrams to set out the structure.

Next we will be beginning to code, starting with the networking for the game.
