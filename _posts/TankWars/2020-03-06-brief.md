The next LLP task for our LLP module is to create a multiplayer turn-based game based around combat. We will need to learn and understand Toby Jones' networking library to add multiplayer into our game and choose from one of two combat systems.

The combat mechanics my team has chosen to implement are:
* A turn-based navigable game grid for combat
* Multiple units supported in a single battleground
* Ability to attack and move
* Unit stats
* Fog of War
* Time Units for movement

<br>
To start we have written out most of the features of our games, and have split tasks to everyone in the group.

The tasks we have decided on are:
* Networking
    * Server
    * Player Clients
    * Sending and Receiving Data
* Input Thread
    * WASD - Move Camera
    * Q/E - Focus On Units
    * Mouse
        * Movement - Move Cursor
        * Left Button - Select
        * Right Button - Deselect
* UI
    * Main Menu
    * Lobby
    * Game
    * Shop
    * Game Over
* Audio
    * Gameplay
        * Selection
        * Deselection
        * Movement
        * Attack
        * Hit
    * UI
        * Button Click
        * Buy Unit
        * Player Joined
    * Music
        * Lobby
        * Game

<br>
I have chosen to implement the UI, since the system I produced for The Shining game worked relatively well, as well as helping out with implementing the networking.
As part of doing this we also setup a rough Gantt Chart to help with organisation, this may be changed and edited throughout the project.
