We have decided to use Trello to help with project management and keep track of how we are progressing. 
Here is our Trello board that we have setup and aim to keep updated throughout the project:

After planning out what we want to include in our game, we need to decide on the structure and architecture we are going to implement. 
Our first class we decided on was a GameObject class which most things would inherit from. GameObjects can have many components and as a standard will have a SpriteComponent and a CollisionComponent. There will be ways to safely add and delete components without memory leaks.

One other thing we decided on pretty quickly was the need for a SceneManager to handle the UI and the rendering of the game. We have 5 screens we want to implement in the game all with either buttons, sprites, text etc. These screens are: Main Menu, Shop, Game, Game Over, Game Won.

For my room generation system, I plan to have a Map class which generates and handles all the rooms as well as a Room class which the rooms for the level can be created from. 
Next, I'm going to work on a UML diagram for all of us to work from, with the classes we intend to have and how they interact with each other.
