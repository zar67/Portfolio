As with our last game, we will be using Trello to keep track of our progress. 

Here is the Trello board I have setup and an updated version of this can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/6CQNjRyr/llp-game-3).

The main inspiration for our game is an asset pack made by Kenney, we will be using this asset pack to create our game but the image that caught our attention was this:

This is how we want our game to look and feel.

Next up is we need to plan out the architecture and structure of our game, the client and server classes are already setup for us, as well as the base game class. 
At the moment our focus is on getting the networking setup correctly, and then we will look at the gameplay afterwards.

We have decided that the messages we need to send over the network are:
* START GAME
* PLAYER MOVE
* PLAYER ATTACK
* PLAYER BUY
* PLAYER END TURN
* PLAYER START TURN

We will setup an enum for this, and use a function to encode the enum and the data into a vector of chars (which will be used to send to the serer).
We will also have a decode function that will convert the vector back into the enum and the correct data.

My UI system will be setup in a very similar way to the previous system with these screens implemented:
* Main Menu
* Lobby Menu
* Game Screen
* Shop
* Game Over

I have decided to implement the shop into the game screen and have a toggle button to show and hide it, I will explain more about the UI layout and structure when I come to planning it, but the basics of it will be a SceneManager class that will have Scene attributes. The SceneManager will handle the rendering and updating of the current scene and also handle transitions between screens.
