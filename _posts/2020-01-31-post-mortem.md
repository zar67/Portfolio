When demoing our game, we received some feedback and tried to implement this before the deadline. We managed to include some of the features and improved our game slightly. 

I'm pretty happy with the result of our game. It's very similar to the game we originally pitched and planned to make with a few missing elements that we didn't implement. For example, we originally wanted the game to get harder as you descended through the levels, with more enemies spawning; however, we didn't get around to implementing this. 

Our game could use some extra polishes like animation, enemies flash when they are hit and the shooting could do with improving. However, for our first attempt at a group project, we have a made a stable game that is easy to understand and (kind of) fun to play.

I think in order to improve we could've started planning and using Trello earlier, splitting the tasks between people in advance. Doing this and starting to code earlier would've given us a more polished game and more time for play testing and bug fixing at the end.

Here is a video of our game:
