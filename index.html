  <h1 class="page-heading">About Me</h1><br>
  <p>I'm an avid programmer, who enjoys being challenged and takes pride in solving problems with a particular passion for educational and serious games.</p>
  <p>I also enjoy gaming, my favourite games to play are sandbox style games like Minecraft and Stonehearth but I try to get out of my comfort zone and play a variety of games.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I am a Sectional Assistant at my local scout troop, I love camping and the outdoors, you can often find me hiking on evenings and weekends.</p>
