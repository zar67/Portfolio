  <p>Hi, I'm Zoe. I'm currently a UWE Games Technology student in Bristol, England. Here you can see some of my personal and university projects that I have worked on.</p><br>
  <p>I have a strong determination and perserverance for any challenge but especially with programming tasks, which sometimes leads me to madness but also means that I'm constantly evolving and improving.</p><br>
  <p> Most of the C++ Projects on this website use an OpenGL Game Framework given to me in one of my year 1 modules which provides basic window and sprite functionality. All collisions, physics, movement and UI features have been implemented by me. Please take a look around and if you have any questions feel free to contact me :)</p>
